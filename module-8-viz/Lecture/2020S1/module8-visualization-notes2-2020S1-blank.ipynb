    "## Project\n",
    "1. Reminder: Project final submissions are due on June 17 at 9AM (**we do not accept late submissions for this assignment**). \n",
    "1. Your TAs are aiming to give you feedback on your milestones as soon as possible but in the meantime, if you have any questions, let them know. \n",
    "1. Reminder: Be sure to schedule your project demo time by tonight (refer to Piazza for more details).\n",

    "## Final Exam\n",
    "1. Reminder: June 22, 2020 at 7PM (Vancouver time). Everyone will have to take it at the same time so for those of you who are in a different timezone, please adjust accordingly.\n",
    "1. Reminder: we will only test on line graphs for the final. The other types of graphs are provided for your interest and in case you need it for the final.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's coming up?\n",
    "1. We will talk about the solution to test 2 on Tuesday. The rest of the time will be a free-form office hour where you can get help with finishing the project. \n",
    "1. Thursday's class (the last one of the semester!) will be when we look at the final exam from 2019W2. We'll release the file and have some time where you work on the question (try to simulate exam conditions if you can) and then we'll cover the answer/approaches together."
