    "# Exam Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the rules into two parts: The part specific to CPSC 103 that you need to read, and UBC's recommended rules for students to agree to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Part We Absolutely Need You to Read\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Work Is Your Own\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work on the exam must be **your own individual work**. You may not discuss the exam in any way with anyone outside of the course staff for CPSC 103.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get (or give!) assistance from someone who is not CPSC 103 course staff on the CPSC 103 exam, you should expect a grade of 0 on your exam and an academic misconduct case against you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible exception:** We are switching to online exams in crisis mode. If you have technical issues *with the online format*, you should ask those of the CPSC 103 course staff. In an emergency you may ask assistance from someone else **ONLY** on such technical issues. You **MUST** acknowledge that person by name with their contribution in the cell below. **DO NOT** take (or give) any assistance on the content of the exam as part of this emergency assistance, not even help reading the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Respect Your Classmates' Lecture Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not access Syzygy/Jupyter during the other section's registered time (12:30-2 if you are in the 3:30-5 section; 3:30-5 if you are in the 12:30-2 section). If possible, complete and submit your exam during your lecture timeslot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You May Use CPSC 103 Resources on Canvas, Syzygy/Jupyter, and Piazza\n",
    "\n",
    "You have access to all our term's content on Canvas, Syzygy/Jupyter, and Piazza. That includes, for example, our design recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Piazza will be closed to new posts during the exam. To ask a question, go to the office hours and help sessions room in Collaborate Ultra at https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/35980/external_tools/5284, \"raise your hand\", and wait for a course staff member to chat privately with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Format and Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "You must download your Jupyter Notebook as a Python (.py) file and submit it on gradescope (https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/46) to receive credit for the exam. Full credit is available only for submissions completed by 8PM. We accept late submissions at a deduction of 2.5% point per hour (or portion of an hour) up to four hours later (midnight). (The exam is pass/fail; so, the grade deduction simply makes it harder to earn a \"pass\".)\n",
