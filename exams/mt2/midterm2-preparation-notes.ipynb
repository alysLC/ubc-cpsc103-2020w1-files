    "Also, as always, **THROUGHOUT the exam:** If we ask you to design a solution, we mean to design it using the appropriate design recipes (i.e., HtDF, HtDD, or both) taught in CPSC 103."

Try designing it once using the `List[Vote]` template. Then, design it once as a composition where you (1) get a list of all the votes for the given choice, (2) get just their e-mail addresses, (3) strip out everything up to the `@` in each one, and (4) return only the unique elements of the list. (Hints: `\"jb@gojoe.com\".find(\"@\")` returns `2`. `x in lox` is `True` exactly when `x` appears as an element in the list `lox`.)\n",
