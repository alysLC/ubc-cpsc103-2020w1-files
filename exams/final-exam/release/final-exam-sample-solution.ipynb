    "\n",
    "### Your Work Is Your Own\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work on the exam must be **your own individual work**. You may not discuss the exam in any way with anyone outside of the course staff for CPSC 103.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get (or give!) assistance from someone who is not CPSC 103 course staff on the CPSC 103 exam, you should expect a grade of 0 on your exam and an academic misconduct case against you.\n",

    "**Possible exception:** We are switching to online exams in crisis mode. If you have technical issues *with the online format*, you should ask those of the CPSC 103 course staff. In an emergency you may ask assistance from someone else **ONLY** on such technical issues.
